# Exploring Foundation Models

This collection of Swift playgrounds provides hands-on examples for learning everything about Apple's Foundation Models framework. Each playground focuses on specific aspects, from basic concepts to better understanding the framework.

It is part of the [Exploring Foundation Models](https://academy.rudrank.com/product/foundation-models) book.

## Overview

The playgrounds are organized into different learning paths, each building upon the previous concepts:

- ** GettingStartedWithSessions** - Core session management and basic interactions
- **GenerationOptionsAndSamplingControl** - Fine-tuning model behavior and output
- **BasicToolUse** - Extending model capabilities with custom tools
- **SupportedLanguagesAndInternationalization** - Working with multiple languages

## Playground Structure

Each playground consists of Swift files that demonstrate progressive concepts. All examples use the `#Playground` directive, allowing them to run directly in Xcode's playground environment.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 26.0 or later
- iOS 26.0+ or macOS 15.6+

## Getting Started with Sessions

The `GettingStartedWithSessions` playground contains examples covering the fundamentals of working with Foundation Models sessions.

## Generation Options and Sampling Control

The `GenerationOptionsAndSamplingControl` playground explores how to fine-tune model outputs through various generation parameters.

## Basic Tool Use

The `BasicToolUse` playground demonstrates how to extend Foundation Models capabilities with custom tools and function calling.

## Supported Languages and Internationalization

The `SupportedLanguagesAndInternationalization` playground covers multilingual capabilities and internationalization features.

## Running the Playgrounds

1. Open the `FoundationLab.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Navigate to the `Playgrounds` folder in the project navigator
3. Select any `.swift` file to open it in the playground editor
4. Click the refresh button to start the Canvas on the right. You can open the canvas by Option + Command + Return.
